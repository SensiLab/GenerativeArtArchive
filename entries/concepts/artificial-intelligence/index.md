# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI), refers to the development of computer systems that are able to carry out intelligent tasks; i.e. tasks that are deemed to be exclusive for humans. This is achieved by enabling systems to simulate, to some degree, human thinking and reasoning.

AI has been widely applied across different areas of science and industry, including self-driving cars, recommender systems, medical diagnosis, etc. and most importantly for this article, in design and the arts. In this space, AI applications have differ in purpose, including to replicate or mimic artistic styles (e.g. the next rembrandt), as a tool that can be used during the creative process (e.g. ), or even to work ‘autonomously’ (e.g. ). 

## Approaches to AI

When referring to AI, many people think about Machine Learning (ML); however, this is only a sub-field of AI, which also involves areas such as automated reasoning, planning, knowledge representation, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. 

Different approaches are also used in AI, such as formal logic, symbolic learning, machine learning (e.g. artificial neural networks, deep learning, etc.), among others. One of the main differences between these different approaches lies in the way the systems are programmed to carry out tasks. Mainly AI approaches can be classified within two categories: 

### Rules-based:
The programmer writes hard-coded rules into the system which represent specific instructions to tell the machine how to address a problem.  

### Examples-based:
These AI approaches are probabilistic in nature, which means that they work within a space of incomplete or uncertain information in order to make predictions and recognise patterns from the data. In this case, the rules are learned by the systems through input datasets or examples.
