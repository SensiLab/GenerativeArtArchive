# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI), refers to the development of computer systems that are able to carry out intelligent tasks; i.e. tasks that are deemed to be exclusive for humans. This is achieved by enabling systems to simulate, to some degree, human thinking and reasoning.

AI has been widely applied across different areas of science and industry, including self-driving cars, recommender systems, medical diagnosis, etc. and most importantly for this article, in design and the arts. In this space, AI applications have differ in purpose such as, to replicate or mimic artistic styles, as a tool that can be used during the creative process, or even to work ‘autonomously’.

## Approaches to AI

When referring to AI, many people think about Machine Learning (ML); however, this is only a sub-field of AI, which also involves areas such as automated reasoning, planning, knowledge representation, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc.

Different approaches are also used in AI, such as formal logic, symbolic learning, machine learning (e.g. artificial neural networks, deep learning, etc.), among others. One of the main differences between these different approaches lies in the way the systems are programmed to carry out tasks. Mainly AI approaches can be classified within two categories: rule-based and example-based approaches.

### Rule-based:

Also known as _symbolic AI_ or _classical AI_. In this case, the programmer writes hard-coded rules into the system to indicate specific instructions that the machine will follow to address a problem. The rules constitute explicit ways in which humans reason and solve problems. The application of rule-based systems is constrained to specific fit-to-purpose solutions due to the deterministic nature of the rules.

### Example-based:

These AI approaches are probabilistic in nature, which means that they work within a space of incomplete or uncertain information in order to make predictions and recognise patterns from the data. Contrary to rule-based systems, these models learn the way to complete a task by identifying patterns and features from input datasets or examples.
