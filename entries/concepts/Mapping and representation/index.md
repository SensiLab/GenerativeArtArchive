# Mapping and Representation

- This entry should aim to illustrate the role of mapping and representation ideas and processes in generative work.
- There are two aspects to generative methods used for creative applications:
  - Data that drives the output. This is where all the algorithms and examples showcased in this repository come into play. Mathematical operations and functions that return numbers. This is what computers are really good at!
  - Mapping of the data to a formal output. This is where the creative aspect of generative methods lies. A stream of generated data points can drive different formal interpretations, from topology to geometry, to sound, only to name a few.
