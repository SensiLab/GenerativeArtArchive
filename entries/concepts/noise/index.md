# Noise

In this article we explore the concept of _noise_, particularly in relationship to computer graphics.

- randomness is a go-to technique for sampling in computational modelling and simulation.
- randomness is also used to generate variation in procedural generation of computer graphics.
- often, the variation produced by using plain randomness is perceived as unnatural, as patterns/features are difficult to extract from randomness (think TV static)
- Noise is used in computer graphics to produce _smooth randomness_. This is, randomness with local coherence.

## How is noise generated?

Generally speaking, the generation of noise can be approached in one of two ways: smoothing a random sequence, or introducing disturbance into a smooth sequence. The most notable example of noise is Perlin Noise
