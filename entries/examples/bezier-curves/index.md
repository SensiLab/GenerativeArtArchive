# Bezier Curves

Introduced by engineer Pierre Bezier in 1960, as a tool for automotive design, a Bezier curve is a smooth continuous curve defined by a start and and end point, as well as a set of intermediate control points.

## How they work

For the example presented below, we have chosen the 'simple' way of defining Bezier curves: linear interpolations, which is essentially picking a point between two other points.
