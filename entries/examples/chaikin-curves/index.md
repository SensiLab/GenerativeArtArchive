# Chaikin Curves

Presented by George Chaikin in 1974 [1], the Chaikin Curves algorithm is recognised as one of the first curve-refinement procedures [2]. The particularity of this approach is that it works directly with the control polygon by “cutting corners”, rather than taking an analytical approach like Bezier Curves

## How it works

The Chaikin Curves algorithm is simple: For a ployline of control points {P1, P2, P3,... Pn } a new set of control points {Q1, R1, Q2, R2, Q3, R3, Qn, Rn} is generated by subdividing a segment {Pi, Pi+1} into four equal segments and defining Qi at ¼ and Ri at ¾. A smoother curve is achieved by iteratively applying the algorithm on the new set of control points.
