# Chaikin Curves

Chaikin curves were introduced by George Chaikin in 1974, as a method to refine/smooth the corners of a polygon. It can be used to generate smooth curves from a series of control points. Check [this](https://sighack.com/post/chaikin-curves) for reference.

## How it works

- iteratively cutting hard corners based on a fixed ratio.
