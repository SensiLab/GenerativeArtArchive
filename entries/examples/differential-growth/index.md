# Differential Growth

The wide variety of complex, and so-called __"organic"__ shapes exhibited by plants and other living organisms, emerges through a process called morphogenesis. Differential growth is the main mechanism driving the formation of these complex shapes and patterns, and as it's name indicates, it is the the carefully regulated process through which cells subdivide and differentiate from each other. However, and despite large efforts into understanding how differential growth is regulated via the influence of genetic and environmental forces, it's guiding principles remain largely unknown [1].




## How it works

In this article we use the metaphor of a rope of interconnected nodes to simulate 2D differential growth.
