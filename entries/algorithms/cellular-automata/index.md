# Cellular Automata

![Complex patterns as they happen in nature](./imgs/ca-shell.jpeg)

Cellular Automata (CA) are discrete models of computation developed originally in the 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann, as reductionist models to study self-replicating systems.

## How they work

A cellular automaton is a dynamic system that consists of a regular grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of a finite number of states at any given time. The state of each cell is updated in discrete time increments,
