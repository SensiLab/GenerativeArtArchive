# Overview

Geometric constructions that appear frequently in nature (cells and crystals), as compressed spatial units find equilibrium. From a computational perspective, Voronoi Tesselation is a space filling algorithm that takes an arbitrary set of points, know as _sites_, as input, and returns a series of regions, in which every point is closer to one _site_.

# How it works

1. Seed the space with _n_ site points.
2. For every other point in the space, measure distance to all site points and return smallest distance.
