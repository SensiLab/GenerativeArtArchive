They were invented by Hungarian theoretical biologist, Aristid Lindenmayer, in 1968 as a way to model the growth of plants and the development of organisms <a href=\"#1\">1</a>. L-systems can generate a variety of complex patterns and shapes, including fractals, which is why they are widely used in computer graphics, generative art, and algorithmic design. The recursive nature of L-systems allows for infinite variations and customizations, making them a versatile tool for creative exploration.</p>\n<h2>How they work</h2>\n<p>L-systems work by defining a set of replacement rules. These rules are applied recursively to an initial string – the <em>axiom</em> –, producing new strings that can be interpreted as instructions for drawing patterns or shapes. The characters in the string represent actions or commands, such as moving forward, turning, or drawing a line.</p>\n<p>As an example, let's use the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A -> AB</li>\n<li>B -> A</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If these rules are recursively applied to the axiom A:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Iteration 1: A -> AB</li>\n<li>Iteration 2: AB -> ABA</li>\n<li>Iteration 3: ABA -> ABAAB</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A live example</h2>\n<iframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 90%\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"L-System\" src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/GenArtRepo/l-systems/tree/main/?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&module=sketch.js&hidedevtools=1\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n<h2>Applications and examples</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Jon McCormack's 7 sisters?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p><a name=\"1\"></a>1.
