A more detailed account of their history can be found in <a href=\"#4\">4</a>, and a more in-depth description of their mathematical characteristics is provided in <a href=\"#3\">3</a>, but for the purpose of this repository, what is important is the fact that Bezier curves became a fundamental for the development of powerful computer graphics tools.</p>\n<h2>How they work</h2>\n<p>For the example presented below, we have chosen the 'simple' way of constructing Bezier curves: linear interpolations ('lerps'). In essence, what <em>lerps</em> do is find values between two other values. For instance, a 3 step <em>lerp</em> between 0 and 3 should find the values at 33% and 66% of the way between the two values. This will return the series [0, 1, 2, 3], where 0 and 3 are the endpoints and 1 and 2 are the interpolation values.\nTo construct a Bezier curve we do recursive <em>lerps</em> between control points. So, if we have 2 control points – a linear Bezier – the curve is defined by the series of points between them, which returns a straight line. With three control points – quadratic Bezier – we first connect the series of interpolation points between o picking a point between two other points.</p>\n<h2>A live example</h2>\n<iframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 90%\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Bezier Curve\" src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/GenArtRepo/bezier-curve/tree/main/?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark?module=sketch.js\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n></iframe>\n<h2>Applications and examples</h2>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a name=\"1\"><a href=\"https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/cubic-bezier-from-math-to-motion/\">Heckel, M.
