On the grid, each cell has eight neighbours, and can be either dead or alive. The state of the cells are updated syncronously based on the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a cell is alive:\n<ul>\n<li>and it has 2 or 3 live neighbours, the cell stays alive.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, the cell dies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If a cell is dead, but has exactly 3 live neighbours, it'll come to life in the next time step.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A live example</h2>\n<iframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 900px\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Game of Life\" src=\"https://codepen.io/crarojasca/embed/gOoXraW\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Gardner, M.
