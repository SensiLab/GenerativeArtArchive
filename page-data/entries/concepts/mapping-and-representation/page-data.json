This is where all the algorithms and examples showcased in this repository come into play. Mathematical operations and functions that return numbers. This is what computers are really good at!</li>\n<li>Mapping of the data to a formal output. This is where the creative aspect of generative methods lies. A stream of generated data points can drive different formal interpretations, from topology to geometry, to sound, only to name a few.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Some examples</h2>"}},"pageContext":{"id":"3c06f801-a536-5c84-9c2b-1f11b6d8c25c","parent__relativeDirectory":"concepts/mapping-and-representation","parent__name":"index","__params":{"parent__relativeDirectory":"concepts","parent__name":"mapping-and-representation"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1624980200","2806632227","37672888","4259328202"],"slicesMap":{}}
